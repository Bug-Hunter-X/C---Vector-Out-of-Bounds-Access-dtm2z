This repository demonstrates a common C++ error: accessing elements outside the bounds of a `std::vector`.  The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cpp` provides a corrected version.  This illustrates the importance of bounds checking in C++ vector operations.  Always ensure your indices are within the valid range of the vector to prevent unexpected crashes and undefined behavior.
